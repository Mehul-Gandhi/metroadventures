# Project Information 

[MetroVentures Mission](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGBr6KSpSo/yqPQ7Wl2mxC4Xrb3cJDCKA/view?utm_content=DAGBr6KSpSo&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor)

## Inspiration
We wanted to address two struggles facing American cities today. First, loneliness has been increasing to epidemic levels, especially in large cities like San Francisco. People are struggling to connect with one another, and we wanted to provide a new avenue for finding real-world social interaction. Second, small businesses have been struggling recently, especially as foot traffic has fallen following the end of the pandemic. We wanted to draw people into relationships with local businesses so that consumers can dive into the treasure trove of culture and commerce all across the city. 

## Function
MetroVentures is a real-world game designed to foster connections between city dwellers and small businesses. Our aim is to invite people into spaces where they feel comfortable exploring into and reaching out towards their community. 
 
MetroVentures begins on a landing screen, where users are prompted with tours passing through a neighborhood of their hometown. They choose one, and the hunt begins. 

MetroVentures is played by locating small businesses, landmarks, and other points of interest along a path. Users are given direction, distance, and – most importantly – clues to help them navigate, as well as a map with a radius to look within. 

Users can use as many or as few clues as they like. If they come within 25 meters of the location, they have solved the puzzle. They are then prompted with an activity, often involving an interaction with local staff or business owners. Thus, users are incentivized to connect with neighbors they might otherwise have walked right past. 


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
